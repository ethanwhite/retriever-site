# ![Data Retriever Logo](img/logo_small.png) The Data Retriever

The Data Retriever is a package manager for data. It downloads, cleans, and
stores publicly available data, so that analysts spend less time cleaning and
managing data, and more time analyzing it.

> “Thanks to the Data Retriever I went from idea to results in 30 minutes, and
> to a submitted manuscript in two months.”
