### Python

The easiest way to install the Data Retriever is using Python. If you have
Python installed run:

```
pip install retriever
```

If you don't have Python installed we recommend
installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) using the default.

### Installers

If you don't want to install Python you can download installers for Windows, OS
X and Ubuntu/Debian Linux from
the [Releases page](https://github.com/weecology/retriever/releases).

#### Windows

* Download the `.exe` file for the most recent release and run it

#### OS X

* Download and unzip the `.zip` file for the most recent release
* Move the .app file into `Applications`
* Run the following commands from the Terminal to add the Data Retriever to your
  path:

{% highlight bash %}
echo "/Applications/retriever.app/Contents/MacOS" > retrieverapp
sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d
sudo mv retrieverapp /etc/paths.d
{% endhighlight %}

#### Ubuntu/Debian
