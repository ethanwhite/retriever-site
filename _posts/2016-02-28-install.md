### Python

The easiest way to install the Data Retriever is using Python. If you have
Python installed run:

```
pip install retriever
```

If you don't have Python installed we recommend
installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) using the default
options in the installer.

### Installers

If you don't want to install Python you can download installers for Windows, OS
X and Ubuntu/Debian Linux from
the [Releases page](https://github.com/weecology/retriever/releases).

#### Windows

* Download the `.exe` file for the most recent release and run it

#### OS X

* Download and unzip the `.zip` file for the most recent release
* Move the .app file into `Applications`
* Run the following commands from the Terminal to add the Data Retriever to your
  path:

{% highlight bash %}
echo "/Applications/retriever.app/Contents/MacOS" > retrieverapp
sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d
sudo mv retrieverapp /etc/paths.d
{% endhighlight %}

#### Ubuntu/Debian

* Download and run the `.deb` file for the most recent release

### Installing from source

Either use pip to install directly from GitHub:

```
pip install git+https://git@github.com/weecology/retriever.git
```

or:

1. Clone the repository
2. `cd` into the repository directory and run `pip install .` (you may need to
    include sudo at the beginning of the command depending on your system).

More extensive documentation for those that are interested in developing can be
found [here](http://retriever.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest).

### R package

The R package wraps the command line interface, so the core Data Retriever needs
to be installed first by following the instructions above. You can then install
the R package using the devtools package (if you don't have devtools installed
run `install.packages('devtools')` first):

```
devtools::install_github('ropensci/rdataretriever')
```

The R package will be available on CRAN (via `install.packages()`)shortly.
